Here is a clip of my presentation at the San Diego Data Library 2015 Data Science Hackathon:

Along with my team, we won 1st or 2nd place. It was not too clear - but it was a pleasure to take part in.

We got to bring light to some important topics in education. And had some great data to support our findings.

Our participation was enjoyed so much that it lead to a collaboration between myself and Monarch. I worked on a dashboard that was to provide student insights for teachers and staff.
