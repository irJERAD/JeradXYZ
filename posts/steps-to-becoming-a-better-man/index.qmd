## List of Portfolio Projects

### Fenua Surf Chronic Doc / App

-   An app meant to interface the world of surf fans and tourists to the island of Tahiti for the 2024 Olympics
-   The first prototype was akin to a Yelp for Surfing in Tahiti (tides, info, swell direction, etc)
    -   However, on further exploration it has been decided that the best medium to truly share the rich culture of Tahiti and it's treasured surf heritage is through a mini-documentary hosted in app form
    -   Unfortunately I do not know how to do this, nor do I have any examples to go by.
-   **Stupid Strategy:** Content, Content Content!
    -   I want to start collecting content in as many forms as possible
    -   I want to be creative in the formats of this content as well as the structure
        -   **Examples:**
            -   It would be cool to provide multiple maps within the app.
                -   The general Apple / Google Maps API version with pin and local approved spots (only able to share surf locations that are unanimously given approval by the locals there)
                    -   MUST HAVE PINS FOR PARKING SPOTS FOR LOCATIONS LISTED ON THE APP
                -   I would love to see some old school hand drawn "secret spot maps" maybe we could blur one of these. Or make a fake or funny version one that includes inside jokes or interesting cultural garnishing.
                -   
            -   Short video interviews with the most local of locals from each spot. Have them share their history with the break. Ask
            -   Take pictures at surf breaks, surf shops, shaper rooms, homes of surf artists, anywhere you hear about that holds significance with the surf community or represents Tahitian surf heritage
