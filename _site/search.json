    "text": "That was, until my math teacher at the time stood up gesturing he had heard enough and said:\n\n“This is ridiculous. The boy is obviously brilliant and should not be held back on account of our inability to reach him”\n\nYou see, I did not pay attention during class and I did not do homework at all - paired with some minor dyslexia and early symptoms of ADD - I was a horrible student. I did, however, LOVE our take home challenges we were given during math class. Designed to tease our sense of intuition and provoke a desire to solve something so revered it lay written along the side of the board calling out anyone who dare solve it.\nIn fact, I became so successful at these problems, my teacher drafted me to join the Mathletes - despite my appalling grades. It was this relationship, which then grew to include chess and competitive chess, that endeared me to this professor. And fortunately so because it was this familiarity which enabled him to stand up for me.\nAfter this debacle, it was clear something needed to change. This is when I began to take ownership of my own education. Something clicked in me. It became clear that academics was not the responsibility of my teachers, nor my parents, nor anyone other than myself.\n\nSo I decided I would Love School\nThe strategy that had the greatest impact on me was rather straight forward: Love School. Loving school was like self-selecting myself to become a nerd. But in order for this to work I had to fall in love with school first.\n\nFake it ’til You Make it\nAfter school, before faced with and whenever procrastinating the start of homework, I talk to myself.\n\n“I love school. I LOVE Math. History is so interesting…”\n\nNow when I work with students I advise them to take that minute between sitting down in class and when the teacher starts talking to meditate. Focus your attention inward. Take time to appreciate just where you are and what you are doing. Appreciate you educational opportunity. Recite the mantra:\n\n“I love this class. I am so lucky to be here. I am grateful for my teacher”\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nSee how far intentional love and affectionate appreciation take you in your personal path through education."

    "text": "“What would you like to be when you grow up?”\n\nThis simple question says a lot about us as a society.\nFor one, how incredibly self-lead we must be! I mean, we are asking 4 and 5 year olds to provide introspective and existential information on the where and what-abouts of their future, both near and far.\nIt was not so long ago - in our relative history as a species - where one was simply born into a future; the one currently held by their parents. The son’s of farmers would grow up working the land with their family to become farmers themselves. The offspring of tradesmen had their cast iron future - son of a blacksmith would grow up to study and become a blacksmith. And the fortunate sons of merchants had their lot in life set afront of them before they could begin to walk it.\nPerhaps the most diverse set of future possibilities belonged to the young women of the past. For they could become the wives of whom ever was so arranged to be their husband. That, however, just does not hold up to the expectations and perceived rights of the future for today’s young women."

    "text": "I love using Kaggle when creating and training deep learning models. Their free, cloud hosted, Jupyter Notebooks are a great resource for Data Science, Machine and Deep Learning enthusiasts such as myself.\n\nIf you too use Kaggle, Paperspace, or another free cloud hosted notebook environment, then you are most definitely familiar with your resources and the management of computing power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne resource to look out for when training deep learning models on image data is the CPU. When a process is being held up on account of the CPU the computer is consider CPU Bound. Because the training of most AI, neural network, deep learning, and machine learning models employs parallelization through the GPU we should be concerned when we notice our process being help up by the CPU.\n\n\nIn-fact, anytime a process overly throttles a single resource we should take note - this usually spells out opportunity for optimisatoin.\n\nFortunately, Kaggle displays our CPU, GPU, and HDD (Hard Disk Drive) usage in the top right corner of the notebook. It is here we can identify when we are running low on resources or have used up our allotted amount of free computing power - if you are using their free tier access.\nBelieve it or not, rendering JPEG files is actually a slow and cumbersome process. Iterating through tens, hundred’s, thousands, or a greater number of images become quite a massive job to take on - and this all happens in the CPU!\n\nThis is an example of the early mentioned CPU Bound process.\n\n A CPU Bound Kaggle Notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check out a pretty straight forward method of helping out our CPUs - reducing the size of our images and requiring less memory to be processed.\n\nHere we are going to use resize_images() from the fastai library.\n\n\ntrn_path = Path('sml')\nresize_images(path/'train_images', dest=trn_path, max_size=256, recurse=True)\n\nHere we:\n\n\nCreate a new training images path trn_path named ./sml/.\nThen, using resize_images() we:\n\nGrab each file in the directory: path/train_images (the images)\nresize each file to a max_size of 256\ndrop the new images in the directory dest=trn_path\nRuning this through each image in the directory\n\n\nWe have taken a collection of 1024px images and reduced their size 4x. Additionally, resize_images() keeps the directory structure in tact, leaving the new images in an identical form exactly where we directed in the dest parameter."

Finding yourself with so many unfinished projects, items on the todo list, or worse, responsibilities that in this familiar destruction, you left someone you care about hanging.

Unable to leave the bed due to the physical experience of anxiety. Even if I manage the overcome the physical impediment, the mental anguish of my inner narrative intimidates me back into my shell.\nSerial episodes of why I am not capable of doing what I already committed myself to - and because I so excitedly and honestly, more accurately, knew I was capable of.\nPlay back-to-back against commercials of my impotence in even starting what I know will take a few minutes when I am on - even in a bad state-of-mind things don’t take more that a honest efforts time to life out the ego fueling experience of taking on and accomplishing something you set out to.\nBecause, in truth, most the things I set out to do I am quite excited to do.

Note: Give yourself a small handful of quick tasks in this category. The pride in self you experience will get you more pumped then when you started the exercise.\n\nIf you are making progress it is OK to endulge in a couple tasks that are categorized in the will cause anxiety and discomfort if you don’t finsih them up sooner than later.\nI find myself jumping to these, likely because it creates the illusion of being more productive than you are - accomplishing things not due yet. Or more likely, cherry picking tasks that, for whatever reason, just don’t rub you as wrong as the first group.\nFinally, if you stick to this system you will find yourself burning with a lot less anxiety and a lot more enthusiasm to take on some cool stuff. This is the time for the third group.\n\nThis has the added benefit of getting to work on passion projects when you will actually complete them.
