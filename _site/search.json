    "text": "As an adventurer I love to sail, surf, and when I can’t hit the ocean I’ll take my surfskate for a cruise. As an explorer I have lived up and down Califonia’s coast - San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Francisco - as well as the South Pacific Island of Tahiti and New Zealand. As a life long learner I am in pursuit of my next certification or digging around the corners of a favorite pastime.\nData or information, knowledge, and the value they can perform is the economy I work in. Building interactive dashboards for real-time action oriented decision making. The crawling, the collecting, the exploring, mutating and munging, working intimately with data to reveal true value and insights.\nI work with young students in their mid-teens as a tutor. A growth mindset and the power of ‘Yet’ are core to my program. Inspiring in students an ownership of their academics. I mentor them to become self-guided learners. Teaching them to meditate on a love for learning and devote themselves to an appreciation of their educational opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California San Diego\nLa Jolla, CA\nB.S. in Cognitive Science | September 2009 - January 2013\nM.n. in Applied Mathematics | September 2009 - January 2013"

    "text": "That was, until my math teacher at the time stood up gesturing he had heard enough and said:\n\n“This is ridiculous. The boy is obviously brilliant and should not be held back on account of our inability to reach him”\n\nYou see, I did not pay attention during class and I did not do homework at all - paired with some minor dyslexia and early symptoms of ADD - I was a horrible student. I did, however, LOVE our take home challenges we were given during math class. Designed to tease our sense of intuition and provoke a desire to solve something so revered it lay written along the side of the board calling out anyone who dare solve it.\nIn fact, I became so successful at these problems, my teacher drafted me to join the Mathletes - despite my appalling grades. It was this relationship, which then grew to include chess and competitive chess, that endeared me to this professor. And fortunately so because it was this familiarity which enabled him to stand up for me.\nAfter this debacle, it was clear something needed to change. This is when I began to take ownership of my own education. Something clicked in me. It became clear that academics was not the responsibility of my teachers, nor my parents, nor anyone other than myself.\n\nSo I decided I would Love School\nThe strategy that had the greatest impact on me was rather straight forward: Love School. Loving school was like self-selecting myself to become a nerd. But in order for this to work I had to fall in love with school first.\n\nFake it ’til You Make it\nAfter school, before faced with and whenever procrastinating the start of homework, I talk to myself.\n\n“I love school. I LOVE Math. History is so interesting…”\n\nNow when I work with students I advise them to take that minute between sitting down in class and when the teacher starts talking to meditate. Focus your attention inward. Take time to appreciate just where you are and what you are doing. Appreciate you educational opportunity. Recite the mantra:\n\n“I love this class. I am so lucky to be here. I am grateful for my teacher”\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nSee how far intentional love and affectionate appreciation take you in your personal path through education."

    "text": "“What would you like to be when you grow up?”\n\nThis simple question says a lot about us as a society.\nFor one, how incredibly self-lead we must be! I mean, we are asking 4 and 5 year olds to provide introspective and existential information on the where and what-abouts of their future, both near and far.\nIt was not so long ago - in our relative history as a species - where one was simply born into a future; the one currently held by their parents. The son’s of farmers would grow up working the land with their family to become farmers themselves. The offspring of tradesmen had their cast iron future - son of a blacksmith would grow up to study and become a blacksmith. And the fortunate sons of merchants had their lot in life set afront of them before they could begin to walk it.\nPerhaps the most diverse set of future possibilities belonged to the young women of the past. For they could become the wives of whom ever was so arranged to be their husband. That, however, just does not hold up to the expectations and perceived rights of the future for today’s young women."

And had some great data to support our findings.\nOur participation was enjoyed so much that it lead to a collaboration between myself and Monarch. I worked on a dashboard that was to provide student insights for teachers and staff."
