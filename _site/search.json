    "text": "That was, until my math teacher at the time stood up gesturing he had heard enough and said:\n\n“This is ridiculous. The boy is obviously brilliant and should not be held back on account of our inability to reach him”\n\nYou see, I did not pay attention during class and I did not do homework at all - paired with some minor dyslexia and early symptoms of ADD - I was a horrible student. I did, however, LOVE our take home challenges we were given during math class. Designed to tease our sense of intuition and provoke a desire to solve something so revered it lay written along the side of the board calling out anyone who dare solve it.\nIn fact, I became so successful at these problems, my teacher drafted me to join the Mathletes - despite my appalling grades. It was this relationship, which then grew to include chess and competitive chess, that endeared me to this professor. And fortunately so because it was this familiarity which enabled him to stand up for me.\nAfter this debacle, it was clear something needed to change. This is when I began to take ownership of my own education. Something clicked in me. It became clear that academics was not the responsibility of my teachers, nor my parents, nor anyone other than myself.\n\nSo I decided I would Love School\nThe strategy that had the greatest impact on me was rather straight forward: Love School. Loving school was like self-selecting myself to become a nerd. But in order for this to work I had to fall in love with school first.\n\nFake it ’til You Make it\nAfter school, before faced with and whenever procrastinating the start of homework, I talk to myself.\n\n“I love school. I LOVE Math. History is so interesting…”\n\nNow when I work with students I advise them to take that minute between sitting down in class and when the teacher starts talking to meditate. Focus your attention inward. Take time to appreciate just where you are and what you are doing. Appreciate you educational opportunity. Recite the mantra:\n\n“I love this class. I am so lucky to be here. I am grateful for my teacher”\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nSee how far intentional love and affectionate appreciation take you in your personal path through education."

    "text": "“What would you like to be when you grow up?”\n\nThis simple question says a lot about us as a society.\nFor one, how incredibly self-lead we must be! I mean, we are asking 4 and 5 year olds to provide introspective and existential information on the where and what-abouts of their future, both near and far.\nIt was not so long ago - in our relative history as a species - where one was simply born into a future; the one currently held by their parents. The son’s of farmers would grow up working the land with their family to become farmers themselves. The offspring of tradesmen had their cast iron future - son of a blacksmith would grow up to study and become a blacksmith. And the fortunate sons of merchants had their lot in life set afront of them before they could begin to walk it.\nPerhaps the most diverse set of future possibilities belonged to the young women of the past. For they could become the wives of whom ever was so arranged to be their husband. That, however, just does not hold up to the expectations and perceived rights of the future for today’s young women."

    "text": "I love using Kaggle when creating and training deep learning models. Their free, cloud hosted, Jupyter Notebooks are a great resource for Data Science, Machine and Deep Learning enthusiasts such as myself.\n\nIf you too use Kaggle, Paperspace, or another free cloud hosted notebook environment, then you are most definitely familiar with your resources and the management of computing power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne resource to look out for when training deep learning models on image data is the CPU. When a process is being held up on account of the CPU the computer is consider CPU Bound. Because the training of most AI, neural network, deep learning, and machine learning models employs parallelization through the GPU we should be concerned when we notice our process being help up by the CPU.\n\n\nIn-fact, anytime a process overly throttles a single resource we should take note - this usually spells out opportunity for optimisatoin.\n\nFortunately, Kaggle displays our CPU, GPU, and HDD (Hard Disk Drive) usage in the top right corner of the notebook. It is here we can identify when we are running low on resources or have used up our allotted amount of free computing power - if you are using their free tier access.\nBelieve it or not, rendering JPEG files is actually a slow and cumbersome process. Iterating through tens, hundred’s, thousands, or a greater number of images become quite a massive job to take on - and this all happens in the CPU!\n\nThis is an example of the early mentioned CPU Bound process.\n\n A CPU Bound Kaggle Notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check out a pretty straight forward method of helping out our CPUs - reducing the size of our images and requiring less memory to be processed.\n\nHere we are going to use resize_images() from the fastai library.\n\n\ntrn_path = Path('sml')\nresize_images(path/'train_images', dest=trn_path, max_size=256, recurse=True)\n\nHere we:\n\n\nCreate a new training images path trn_path named ./sml/.\nThen, using resize_images() we:\n\nGrab each file in the directory: path/train_images (the images)\nresize each file to a max_size of 256\ndrop the new images in the directory dest=trn_path\nRuning this through each image in the directory\n\n\nWe have taken a collection of 1024px images and reduced their size 4x. Additionally, resize_images() keeps the directory structure in tact, leaving the new images in an identical form exactly where we directed in the dest parameter."

The fortune filled me with anticipation for lay ahead. My time is spent with my wife, Stephanie, in our beautiful home in Punaauia, Tahiti. Only 200 meters from our parents home, we enjoy breakfast, lunch, and dinner together as a family every day. Steph’s father is an impressive chef with a recipe collection capable of bringing out the glutton in me.\nTwo days each week I enjoy spending a quick 40 minutes with the students I work with in San Francisco. Whether covering new material, reviewing problems, or discussing our goals outside and beyond high school, I have found some of my most fulfilling moments with these children.\nEach time I recount my first visit to Eglise Bonne Nouvelle in Faʻaʻā, I trip out or get goose bumps and feel filled with purpose and potential. I came on the invitation of the only other couple I could speak English with - outside my immediate family that is.\nI had been suffering from a strange type of loneliness. I lived with my wife and we stayed home most days together. We would join our parents down the street for breakfast, lunch, and dinner each and everyday. French was the language necessary to navigate butter and bread across our table. I was afforded the occasional courteous English commands. And fun idioms where anyone’s game to say, and then, for me, explain.\nUnknowingly, at first, the symptoms of this strange loneliness would take hold in dormant areas of my psyche. Keeping to ourselves by custom, I did not interact with many people outside our household. While rousing when passing neighbors and the like, the lack of a shared tongue rendered me incapable of experiencing any depth in human interaction.\nAlong come Marc and Jo - the friendly hosts of English Speakers in Tahit.\nThey took me on a trail that went just the right amount further than I was comfortable hiking, pointing out some of French Polynesia’s treasures. Atop the mountain I was gifted a view of Punaauia’s legendary orange tree fields.\nAfter our hike together a newly acquainted friend shared some juice with us as we talked a little more about ourselves. I found a friend in Jo a skateboarder who was “keen” to take me downtown to shred the local park.\nMarc and Jo were also excited to show me their local church. The Sunday I met them their is what this article was supposed to be about!\nI enjoyed a worship"

Or, is it, the missing of something special or some special place.\nDid you reach out to place down your cup of coffee, only to hear it shatter upon the floor at your toes. The corner table or bar you had envisioned so perfectly in your minds eye had no such place in the physical world.\nWhat about when you reach out, across the table to palm the keys, only to find you have copped a tangle of loose paperclips jammed between your fingers.\nWe inhabit so many ingeniously designed environments with natural grace at a pace of location to location. Each within arms reach of an arms reach. This can result in some fascinating experiences of cognitive dissonance, while we the being, act as though an expected location or item lay there in its entirety as well as interact with all governing appendages through natural and causally expected laws of mechanics."
