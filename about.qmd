### This Site Current Construction  

This site is a place for me to organize my current self and support my ongoing development.


### Profesional and Academic  

You can find my professional curriculum vitae - [CV](/CV) - beside my academic endeavors and educational exploits. Come in closer for my personal tastes explored through pastimes and experience laden opinions.  


### Should You Know Further More  

If you would like to explore an ongoing conversation with myself and developing personal philosophy, browse [The Dry Dock](https://TDD.jerad.xyz). There you can find my best attempt at capturing what it is I believe and who it is I find one could become if they knew such themselves.
